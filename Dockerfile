# NOTE: this image does NOT train the model. model.pkl and metrics.json
# are produced by train_model.py in CI (see .github/workflows/ci.yml) and
# must already exist in the build context before `docker build` runs.
# This keeps training reproducible, cacheable, and testable independently
# of the image, and means every image is built from a model that has
# already passed the CI quality gate.
#
# Base image is pinned to -bookworm (Debian 12) rather than the floating
# python:3.11-slim tag. As of this writing, an unpinned python:3.11-slim
# resolves to Debian 13 "trixie" - a release too new to have accumulated
# security backports yet, which showed up as ~20 HIGH/CRITICAL OS-level
# CVEs with no fix available in a Trivy scan. Bookworm has a mature,
# actively-maintained patch cadence. Revisit this pin periodically as
# trixie matures.

# via /opt/venv/bin/python (see PATH above) - so this is pure unused
# attack surface. A Trivy scan flagged 4 HIGH CVEs living entirely in
# this unused system copy (old vendored jaraco.context/wheel inside
# setuptools, plus ensurepip's frozen setuptools/wheel/msgpack wheels)
# even after the venv's own pip/setuptools/wheel were upgraded - those
# fixes never touch this separate, dormant copy. `|| true` because the
# exact file layout can shift between Python patch releases; this is a
# best-effort hardening step, not something that should ever block a
# build if a path has moved.
